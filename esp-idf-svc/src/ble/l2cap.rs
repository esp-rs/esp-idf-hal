//! NimBLE L2CAP connection-oriented channels (CoC): a credit-based data pipe that runs *parallel*
//! to GATT (both over a GAP connection), exposed as operations on the [`BleDriver`].
//!
//! Requires a NimBLE build with CoC enabled (`CONFIG_BT_NIMBLE_L2CAP_COC_MAX_NUM > 0`); the whole
//! module is `#[cfg]`-gated on that. A channel is opened either by listening on a PSM
//! ([`l2cap_create_server`](BleDriver::l2cap_create_server)) or by connecting to a peer's PSM
//! ([`l2cap_connect`](BleDriver::l2cap_connect)). Both, plus received SDUs and flow-control
//! notifications, are delivered to the single [`l2cap_subscribe`](BleDriver::l2cap_subscribe) hook.
//!
//! Flow control is credit-based and manual: after handling a [`L2capEvent::Received`] you replenish
//! the peer's credits with [`l2cap_recv_ready`](BleDriver::l2cap_recv_ready); a
//! [`l2cap_send`](BleDriver::l2cap_send) that
//! runs out of credits reports [`SendOutcome::Stalled`] and resumes on [`L2capEvent::TxUnstalled`].
