//! Pulse Counter (PCNT) peripheral.
//!
//! The PCNT (Pulse Counter) module is designed to count the number of rising
//! and/or falling edges of input signals. The ESP32 chip contains multiple pulse
//! counter units in the module. The number of available units and channels is
//! different for each chip. See the [Technical Reference Manual] of your chip for
//! details (or the table below).
//!
//! Each unit is in effect an independent counter with multiple channels (see [`PcntChannel`]),
//! where each channel can increment/decrement the counter on a rising/falling
//! edge. Furthermore, each channel can be configured separately.
//!
//! Besides that, PCNT unit is equipped with a separate glitch filter, which is
//! helpful to remove noise from the signal. See
//! [`PcntUnitDriver::set_glitch_filter`](pcnt::PcntUnitDriver::set_glitch_filter) for details.
//!
//! Typically, a PCNT module can be used in scenarios like:
//! - Calculate periodic signal's frequency by counting the pulse numbers within a time slice
//! - Decode quadrature signals into speed and direction
//! - Count the number of pulses that happen within a time slice (e.g. step signal of a stepper motor driver)
//!

//!
//! # Driver redesign in ESP-IDF 5.0
//!
//! In ESP-IDF 5.0, the [PCNT API was redesigned] to simplify and unify the usage of the
//! PCNT peripheral.
//!
//! It is recommended to use the new API, but for now the old API is available through
//! the `pcnt-legacy` feature. The ESP-IDF 6.0 release will remove support for the legacy API.
//!
//! [PCNT API was redesigned]: https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/migration-guides/release-5.x/5.0/peripherals.html#pulse-counter-driver
//!
//! # Chip Capabilities
//!
//! The following table is based on the ESP-IDF source code and the relevant
//! constants are not public. Therefore, this table might be inaccurate or incomplete.
//!
//! |         | Units | Channels | Extra Watchpoints |
//! |---------|-------|----------|-------------------|
//! | esp32   | 8     | 2        | 2                 |
//! | esp32c6 | 4     | 2        | 2                 |
//! | esp32h4 | 4     | 2        | 2                 |
//! | esp32p4 | 4     | 2        | 2                 |

//! | esp32s3 | 4     | 2        | 2                 |
//!
//! **Units**: Maximum number of [`PcntUnitDriver`](pcnt::PcntUnitDriver) that can be created
//!
//! **Channels**: Maximum number of [`PcntChannel`](pcnt::PcntChannel) channels for each unit
//!
//! **Extra Watchpoints**: Maximum number of watchpoints (in addition to zero point and high/low limits) that can be set for each unit.
//!
//! The values seem to map to the following constants in `esp-idf-sys`:
//! - Maximum number of units: [`SOC_PCNT_UNITS_PER_GROUP`]
//! - Maximum number of channels per unit: [`SOC_PCNT_CHANNELS_PER_UNIT`]
//! - Maximum number of extra watchpoints: [`SOC_PCNT_THRES_POINT_PER_UNIT`]

    ///
    /// If the level actions are set to [`Keep`] for **high** level and `Hold` for **low** level,
    /// the counter will only count up **while** the level signal is **high** and ignore
    /// rising edges while the level signal is **low**.
    ///
    /// If the level actions are set to [`Inverse`] for high level and [`Keep`] for **low** level,
    /// it will count down **while** the level is **high** on rising edges and count up **while**
    /// the level is **low** on rising edges.
    ///
    /// You can think of the level actions like this:
    /// ```ignore
    /// let mut counter: i32 = 0;
    /// let mut increment = 1;
    ///
    /// loop {
    ///     // read the level signal and set the action accordingly:
    ///     let action = {
    ///         if level_signal_is_high() {
    ///             high_act
    ///         } else { // if it is not high, it must be low
    ///             low_act
    ///         }
    ///     };
    ///
    ///     // If it was previously set to Hold, increment would be 0, but with
    ///     // the actions Keep/Inverse it should start counting again
    ///     // -> it is set to 1 here
    ///     if increment == 0 && !matches!(action, ChannelLevelAction::Hold) {
    ///         increment = 1; // reset increment to default
    ///     }
    ///
    ///     // level is high, so set increment based on high_act
    ///     match action {
    ///         ChannelLevelAction::Keep => {}, // do nothing, increment stays 1
    ///         ChannelLevelAction::Inverse => { increment = -increment; }, // invert increment
    ///         ChannelLevelAction::Hold => { increment = 0; }, // hold increment (no counting)
