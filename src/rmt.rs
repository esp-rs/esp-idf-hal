//! RMT (Remote Control) peripheral support.
//!
//! The RMT (Remote Control Transceiver) peripheral was designed to act as an infrared transceiver.
//! However, due to the flexibility of its data format, RMT can be extended to a versatile and
//! general-purpose transceiver, transmitting or receiving many other types of signals.
//! From the perspective of network layering, the RMT hardware contains both physical and data
//! link layers. The physical layer defines the communication media and bit signal representation.
//! The data link layer defines the format of an RMT frame. The minimal data unit in the frame is
//! called the RMT symbol, which is represented by [`Symbol`] in the driver.
//!
//! ESP32 contains multiple channels in the RMT peripheral. Each channel can be independently
//! configured as either transmitter or receiver.
//!
//! Typically, the RMT peripheral can be used in the following scenarios:
//! - Transmit or receive infrared signals, with any IR protocols, e.g., NEC
//! - General-purpose sequence generator
//! - Transmit signals in a hardware-controlled loop, with a finite or infinite number of times
//! - Multi-channel simultaneous transmission
//! - Modulate the carrier to the output signal or demodulate the carrier from the input signal
//!
//! # Driver redesign in ESP-IDF 5.0
//!
//! In ESP-IDF 5.0, the [RMT API was redesigned] to simplify and unify the usage of the
//! RMT peripheral.
//!
//! It is recommended to use the new API, but for now the old API is available through
//! the `rmt-legacy` feature. The ESP-IDF 6.0 release will remove support for the legacy API.
//!
//! [RMT API was redesigned]: https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/migration-guides/release-5.x/5.0/peripherals.html#rmt-driver
